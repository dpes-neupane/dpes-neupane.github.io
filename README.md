## Boids Simulation
This is a very simple simulation of the flock behaviour of various animals found in nature. This algorithm was described by [Craig Reynolds] (http://www.red3d.com/cwr/) and the pseudocode was described in this [website] (http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/boids/pseudocode.html#ref1).
The pseudocode has to be tweaked in some places. For example, the rules for the boids are only activated when other boids are closer to the given boid by some threshold value. There are other as well. Although, there is some problem with the direction the boid travels, I could not mitigate it.
